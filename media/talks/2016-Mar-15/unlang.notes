* argument: use JSON/YAML/other static data-only language
- meh.
- just avoids the scripting problem, moving it elsewhere.
- no opportunity to compile-down
- painful to type JSON interactively
- doesn't support exploratory analysis
- DSLs awkward
- no language design
- I hate having to put double quotes around everything
- will never support interaction with complex number types, bignums, matrices, tensors, etc.
